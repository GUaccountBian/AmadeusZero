## Project Statement:

Our team will develop an intelligent chatbot that converts user speech into text, interacts with the OpenAI GPT API to obtain a response and sentiment analysis, and uses a text-to-speech model to vocalize the response. The chatbot will be deployable on both PCs and smartphones. Future updates may include the ability to access the internet for real-time information retrieval.

## Project Requirements:

**Speech-to-Text Functionality**: Convert user speech input into written text.

**GPT API Interaction**: Send the written text to the GPT API to generate a response and analyze the sentiment.

**Text-to-Speech Functionality**: Convert the generated text response into spoken output. The tone of the speech should reflect the sentiment analysis result.

**Deployment**: Ensure the chatbot is deployable on both PC and smartphone platforms.

**Future Update Consideration**: Design the chatbot to be adaptable for future features, such as accessing the internet for real-time information.

## Feasibility and Level of Hardness:

This project is very feasible with the right planning and the use of existing technologies. The speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities are well-established technologies and there are several APIs and libraries we can use. Interacting with the OpenAI GPT API is straightforward with the proper setup and credentials. Deploying the chatbot on different platforms will require some additional work, but again, there are existing tools and platforms we can utilize. The future update consideration might be the most challenging, but if we design our chatbot with adaptability in mind, it's very achievable.
